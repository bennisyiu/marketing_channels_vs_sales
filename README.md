# Marketing Channels’ Impact on Sales Data

In this project, we will analyze a small business' historical marketing promotion data. Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where the business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. The company is now trying to include other variables that can help them target their marketing efforts.

We will conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to estimate sales from a combination of independent variables. This will include:

- Exploring and cleaning data
- Using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables
- Creating a fitting multiple linear regression model
- Checking model assumptions
- Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders
